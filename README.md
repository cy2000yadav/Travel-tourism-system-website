# Travel-tourism-system-website

The project was developed in PHP technology where I created a website based on a travel and tourism booking system in which a user can register and then login into the website and can select or choose their own destinations where they want to travel. After the user has booked the data will get stored in PhpMyAdmin Database where the admin can view the details and contact the user via their provided email and number. Also, I created Admin Panel where only the admin can log in and view the user details. I also provided a Contact Us form in which if the user has a query then he/she can contact via Contact Us Section.
